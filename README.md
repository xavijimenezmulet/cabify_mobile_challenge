# cabify_mobile_challenge
Implement an app where a user can pick products from a list and checkout them to get the resulting price. No need to implement any real payment system, but we do need a nice user experience where our customers can understand what items are they purchasing, the price and the discount we are applying. You should fetch the list of products from here.
